#testing the arithmetic of the landlord guaranteed minimum compensation difference
#Now first we define the variables and the logic


#If net revenue < lgmc_number:
#Landlord pays difference:
#lgmc_num - net_revenue
#Right?
#If thereâ€™s not enough net revenue to pay us the guaranteed minimum, landlord has to come out of their pocket to make up that difference
#lgmc_num = lgmc_percentage * min_comp


#The variables are:
#1 net revenue (already calculated)
#2 Minimum Compensation (alread calculated)

#Cases
